People actually come here?

I'm Stuart Rutherford, mostly a backend software developer who writes frontend gadgets for competitive Pok√©mon players because they're easier to show off.

Even though everything here is written in Javascript, I actually have experience in plenty of languages including Python, Go and Kotlin.

## Projects

The [Pokemon Set Reverser] takes a Pokemon's Species, Forme, Nature and Stats and calculates how it has been trained - valuable for people wanting to recreate teams they find on the in-game ladder.

The [Pokemon Moveset Planner] accepts a [Pokemon Showdown] Pokemon export and tells you how to obtain the Pokemon with the given moves.

The [Pokemon Tournament Resistance Calculator] can be used to calculate your opponents' collective win ratio, which is used to determine your chances at making the single elimination stage of live Pokemon events.

I also work on [SableyeBot], a Discord bot that returns information specifically relevant to people who play Pokemon competitively.

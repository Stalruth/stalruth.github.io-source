This page is a list of tools created by Stuart Rutherford for competitive pokemon players.

The [Pokemon Set Reverser] takes a Pokemon's Species, Forme, Nature and Stats and calculates how it has been trained - valuable for people wanting to recreate teams they find on the in-game ladder.

The [Pokemon Moveset Planner] accepts a [Pokemon Showdown] Pokemon export and tells you how to obtain the Pokemon with the given moves.

The [Pokemon Tournament Resistance Calculator] can be used to calculate your opponents' collective win ratio, which is used to determine your chances at making the single elimination stage of live Pokemon events.

I also work on [SableyeBot], a Discord bot that returns information specifically relevant to people who play Pokemon competitively.
